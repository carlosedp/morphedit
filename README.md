# Morphedit Audio Editor

![Logo](./public/MorphEdit-Logo-Small.png)

Morphedit is a browser-based audio editor built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and wavesurfer.js. It supports waveform visualization, zoom, markers, and regions. State management is handled by Zustand, and the UI uses Material-UI (MUI).
