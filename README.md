## üéµ About

MorphEdit is a powerful, browser-based audio editor designed for preparing audio files for samplers and hardware instruments. While offering some features for the **MakeNoise Morphagene** granular synthesis module, it serves as a versatile tool for general audio editing tasks including splicing, cropping, fading, and concatenation making it perfect for audio sample manipulation across various sampling devices.

**No installation required** - runs entirely in your browser with professional-grade audio processing capabilities.

**Complete privacy** - all audio processing happens locally in your browser, ensuring your files never leave your device and **never get uploaded to a server**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Online (Recommended)

Visit the [live application](https://carlosedp.github.io/morphedit/) - no installation required!

### Option 2: Install as PWA (Progressive Web App)

For offline use and a native app experience:

1. Visit the [live application](https://audioedit.carlosedp.com) in Chrome, Firefox*, or Edge
2. Look for the "Install" button in your browser's address bar or menu
3. Click "Install MorphEdit" to add it to your desktop/home screen
4. Launch anytime as a standalone app with full offline functionality

**Benefits of PWA installation:**

- Works offline after initial load
- Native app-like experience
- No browser UI clutter
- Desktop shortcut/app launcher integration
- Automatic updates when online

*Note: Firefox may require enabling PWA support in `about:config` (search for `browser.taskbarTabs.enabled`) and restart your browser. Support for it is still not 100% functional, so Chrome or Edge is recommended for the best experience in this install option.

### Option 3: Download Desktop App

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/carlosedp/morphedit/releases).

### Option 4: Run from Source

First install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (a modern JavaScript runtime) according to the Bun Website. We use Bun for its speed and efficiency in handling JavaScript projects, including TypeScript support and fast package management instead of Node.js, npm or yarn.

Then clone the repository and run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlosedp/morphedit.git
cd morphedit
bun install
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application.
